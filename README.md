# Introduction

This repository contains the code used to produce results from the paper [Probabilistic Iterative Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12615) by [Jon Cockayne](http://www.joncockayne.com), [Ilse C.F. Ipsen](https://ipsen.math.ncsu.edu), [Chris J. Oates](http://oates.work) and [Tim W. Reid](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/twreid/).
The code is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org) and the main results are generated by the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks [PushforwardPlots.ipynb](julia/PushforwardPlots.ipynb) and [MMD.ipynb](julia/MMD.ipynb).
The former contains the results presented in Sections 5.3 and 5.5, while the latter contains the results from Section 5.4.
